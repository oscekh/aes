# aes

This is an implementation of AES encryption done with the purpose of learning about AES. It only supports encryption but decryption could be added fairly easily using the existing code.

It is based on the NIST standard: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf


This should not actually be used for any serious encryption.
